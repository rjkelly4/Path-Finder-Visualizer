# Path Finder Visualizer

To see the website: [Path Finder Visualizer](https://rjkelly4.github.io/Path-Finder-Visualizer/).

## About the Project

Supports 4 different path finding algorithms:
- Dijikstra's Algorithm
- A*
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)

These algorithms can be visualized to find the shortest path (besides DFS which doesn't guarantee it) from the source node
(green) to the end node (red) with any obstacle the user wants to put up in the form of walls (click on a square to add one).

The React App also supports the switching of modes to a mobile view if you are on a phone or tablet by switching from a 20x35 grid to a smaller
10x20 grid.

Hopefully this project can be used by anyone trying to explore/learn these path finding techniques with a hands-on experience instead of just theory!
